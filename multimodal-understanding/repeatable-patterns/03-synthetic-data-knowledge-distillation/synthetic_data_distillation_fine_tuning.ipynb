    "# Generating Synthetic Data and Distilling Knowledge to Fine-Tune Smaller Models with Amazon Nova Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will walk you through the process of utilizing a larger language model (LLM) like Amazon Nova Pro, Amazon's latest and most advanced model, to create a dataset for instruction fine-tuning. This dataset will be used to perform distillation by fine-tuning a smaller model, such as Amazon Nova Micro\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging the capabilities of Amazon Nova Pro, we can generate high-quality, concise training data that enhances the performance of smaller models. This approach is particularly useful for tasks that require detailed and specific instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we begin, ensure that you have access to Amazon Nova Pro, which is now available on Amazon Bedrock foundation models. You can find the dataset `deepmind/aqua_rat` we will be using [here](https://huggingface.co/datasets/deepmind/aqua_rat).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run the notebook on an Amazon SageMaker Studio notebook, or a SageMaker notebook instance without manually setting your aws credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get started!\n",
    "\n",

This model is particularly advantageous for developers and organizations looking to implement advanced AI capabilities without the need for extensive computational resources. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prequisites\n",
    " In order to follow along in this notebook, you'll need access to the following:\n",
    "\n",
    " - An AWS account with Amazon Bedrock model access to Amazon's frontier models. See the model access page [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access-modify.html).\n",

    "### In this notebook, we perform the following high level steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Evaluate Initial Performance**: We explore and prepare questions and answer dataset. Then we assess the quality and performance of sample inference responses from Amazon Nova Pro and Micro models using the deepmind/aqua_rat dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Generate Synthetic Training Data**: We create synthetic training data with Amazon Nova Pro, which serves as the teacher model.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Perform Knowledge Distillation**: We first transform systhetic data in the training dataset format needed to fine-tune Amazon Nova model. We then fine-tune Amazon Nova Micro using the synthetic training dataset generated by Amazon Nova Pro.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test the Fine-Tuned Model**: We deploy the the fine tuned model Amazon Nova Micro using Bedrock's Provisioned Throuput feature, and evaluate the fine-tuned model by testing it against the test dataset to demonstrate the improvement in response quality when compared against base model.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Conclusion**: The notebook concludes with a summary of the knowledge distillation process and highlights how the teacher model's expertise is effectively transferred to the smaller student model. \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Cleanup**: At the end of the notebook, we provide guidance on cleaning a fine-tuned custom model artifact, and Bedrock's Provisioned Throughput capacity used to deploy the fine-tuned custom model."
